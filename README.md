# Catcher+ as of 7/17/2024 (All Star Break)

I created this as a way to come up with who are the best catchers at controling what they control. This includes pop time, exchange time, and arm strength. All three stats which can be found on baseball savant. I decided to go with just the pop time to second because that is a lot more common and I filtered out those who had 10 or less throws to second. 

This is the same as all the other "+" stats out there. League average is 100 and any number above or below that is the precentage that player is better or worse than league average. For example, 105 would be 5% better than league average. The times for each of the three categories I used are small so there isn't as big of a disparity like you see with the other "+" stats. 

I have attached the results.
